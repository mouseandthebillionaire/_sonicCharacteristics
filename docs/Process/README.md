## Inititial Ideas | 09.01.23

###  [Say what now what now?](https://youtu.be/_Ge4_stUpqs?t=19) <sup>[1](#####1)</sup>

We have here a few initial ideas for design goals and themes to explore. Beyond that? Who knows!

### Main Concepts/Ideas
* The primary motivation is to explore the ways in which sounds can contribute to reflective game experiences. Obviously this leaves a fairly wide-open field in which to continue.
* One secondary area of interest for exploration is the "character creation" menu.

These two ideas are further examined below:

### Sound and Reflective Game Experiences
How can sound contribute to the idea of reflective game experiences (or, per Hallnäs<sup>[2](#####2)</sup> those experiences in which we focus on the ways design can "provide time for reflection through intrinsic slowness" rather than entertainment)? But, specifically, how does <em>sound</em> help? Hallnäs mentions five ways in which technology can be slow. It takes time to:
1. learn how it works
2. understand why it works the way it works
3. apply it
4. see what it is
5. find out the consequences of using it

For reflective game design, two interesting approaches arise from this. How can we use slow technology methods to cause the user to reflect on the game itself ("what does this make me think about the nature of games?") AND/OR reflect on the why ("what does this say about the greater world?") The first question seems as good a place of any to start. So what functional aspect of games can we use towards technological "envelopment" ("turning the functional perspective...into a search for mastering the technology as means of expressions, as means of expressing."<sup>[3](#####3)</sup>)?

### Character Creation Menus
Mainly because of recent experiences with the character/stat management screens of two <em>very</em> different games ([Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/) and [Olli Olli World](https://store.privatedivision.com/en/game/olliolli-world)), the idea of exploring a character's sonic thumbprint is of particular interest.

The basic idea builds on the concepts of a previous sound installation. [zipCoda](http://www.mouseandthebillionaire.com/zipCoda/) creates a generative soundtrack for different US zip codes based on data scraped from the 2010 census. Can we do the same thing for character creation? Can the character traits be set on a sonic continuum to create an individual "theme song" for your character? And then, how might this affect how the player feels about their character? Additionally (and perhaps more immediately compelling), what kind of stand-alone experience could be made from these ideas? Could you create a David O'Reilly [Mountain](https://www.davidoreilly.com/mountain) experience where the player answers a few questions and a unique visual/soundscape is created? Could that sound/visual creation be then modified visually and/or sonically with immediate changes taking place in the other plane? This kind of audio/visual "toy" feels like a fun space to do some experimentation.

There seem to be a few possible directions:
* Textual input (questions) leading to sonic/visual "thing"
* Manipulate a visual character/thing that creates a unique song
* Manipulate sonic parameters that then creates a visible representation (character, object, diorama, etc) of that sound

Let us dwell on this for a bit.
