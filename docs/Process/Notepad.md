## Order of Questions
Time to get down to brass tacks and think about what the order of these questions should be:

* Intro
* How are you feeling today -> effects Q?
* Oh yeah? How many hours of sleep did you get last night? ->
* Gotcha. How much time did you spend on screen yesterday?
* Would you say that that is normal for you?
* WEIRD ASIDE (pick from a few?)
* Which animal is best?
* You have just moved to a new city by yourself. You haven't made any close friendships yet, but have invited a few coworkers to your place for drinks. What food would you serve to ensure that they are thoroughly impressed but doesn't show that you have overthought this?
* What color was your childhood bedroom?
* Over the last 9 months, how many books have you read?
* CHANGE: make this something for the player to read, a short story maybe told in the second person - could be tied to the book question?
* True of False: You would be a good person to have around in a crisis
* I've started to play same music based on your choices, what do you think about it so far?
