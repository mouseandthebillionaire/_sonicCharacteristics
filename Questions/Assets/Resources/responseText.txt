Oh really? Okay, then what if I did this to the audio?
That makes me think that I should adjust the sound like this.

Okay, yeah. Got it. This should sound nice in that case.
Let's make it sound a little more like this then.
Huh. Okay. What if I make it sound this way?
Oh, yeah let's adjust this then.
